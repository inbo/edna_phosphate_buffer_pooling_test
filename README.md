## edna_phosphate_buffer_pooling_test
This repository contains code and analyses for evaluating whether pooling DNA extractions from multiple supernatant replicates (1 ml Ã— 3) provides additional biodiversity information compared to using a single replicate.

### Background
In ongoing soil biodiversity monitoring with eDNA metabarcoding at INBO, DNA extractions are performed after phosphate-buffer pre-treatment of soil samples (Taberlet et al., 2012b). Our standard workflow currently involves recovering 1 ml of supernatant in triplicate, extracting DNA separately, and pooling equimolar volumes prior to PCR amplification (Olig01, Coll01, Inse01, InseKP, 18S). This approach is labor- and cost-intensive.
We hypothesize that sequencing only a single replicate yields comparable richness and diversity estimates to pooled triplicates, without significant loss of ecological information.

### Objectives
- Compare alpha diversity (richness, Shannon, Simpson) between pooled triplicate extractions and single replicate extractions.
- Quantify overlap in detected taxa across treatments (shared/unique OTUs/ASVs/genera/species).
